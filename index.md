## Software Design and Engineering

### Microprocessor Simulator Discription

  The original single stage and parts of the five-stage pipeline microprocessor simulator was created during the winter semester of 2015 at the University of Michigan as part the of microprocessor class that I have completed there.  The purpose of the simulator is to create a microprocessor in software that can execute a provided instruction set architecture.
  
  I selected the microprocessor simulator for the engineering portion of my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to create, design, and test hardware while abstracting the physical components into software.  The simulator also shows that I have the ability to program in C and that I understand modern microprocessor architecture and design.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Implementation of a Binary Search Tree

  The binary search tree (BST) program that I included uses a BST data structure to store and organize a special data type called Bid, which contains information on items sold through an auction.  The original program was written in C++ on October 11, 2017 for the CS-260 course.
  
  I selected the specialized BST implementation for the algorithms and data structures portion of my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to program using the C++ programing language and that I have solid understanding of how to write and implement recursive algorithms that require the use of custom data types.

## Databases

### Implementation of a MongoDB RESTful API

  The MongoDB RESTful API was created to provide an interface between the Mongo Database native CRUD operations and an outside program or website.  The original program was written in PyMongo on January 15, 2018 for the CS-340 course.

  I selected the MongoDB RESTful API for the databases portion of my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to implement modern programming techniques for web services, to use the Python scripting language, and to work with modern databases like Mongo.
